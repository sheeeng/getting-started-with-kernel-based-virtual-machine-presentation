## Overview of Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)

- An open source virtualization technology built into LinuxÂ®. Turn Linux into a hypervisor. Allows a host machine to run multiple, isolated virtual environments called guests or virtual machines (VMs).
- KVM is part of Linux. Available from Linux 2.6.20 or newer.

## Abstract (Part 1)

Want to get started with Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)? Want to run a virtual machine on your system using open source technologies? Want to interact with KVM virtual machines from command line interface (CLI)? In this tutorial, Leonard will be teaching people to familiarize themselves with KVM technologies, which allows virtual machines to run with near native performance.

---

## Abstract (Part 2)

Participants must have a basic knowledge on how Linux operating system works, and must have a Linux based operating system running natively on a laptop in order to join this tutorial. We will be focusing on doing some tasks of creating, accessing, modifying, and deleting KVMs, from both graphical user interface (GUI) and CLI.

---

## Abstract (Part 3)

We will busy with these virt-manager tools in the tutorial. - virt-install is a command line tool which provides an easy way to provision operating systems into virtual machines. - virt-viewer is a lightweight UI interface for interacting with the graphical display of virtualized guest OS. It can display VNC or SPICE, and uses libvirt to lookup the graphical connection details.

---

## Abstract (Part 4)

At the end of this tutorial, participants are expected to know how to check if KVM is supported on their hardware, create and manager KVMs with confident, from both GUI and CLI.
